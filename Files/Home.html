	<p class="intro">Since 2000, significant efforts have been made toward achieving universal primary education.
		 The global number of children out of school has been reduced by about half. By 2015, the overall enrollment 
		 rate in developing regions has reached 91%. Moreover, literacy rates have soared, and more girls are attending 
		 school than ever before, showing remarkable progress. However, challenges continue to disrupt developing 
		 regions due to high poverty rates, armed conflicts, and other crises. Ongoing conflicts in Western Asia and
		North Africa have led to an increase in the number of children not attending school. Sub-Saharan Africa, despite
		 facing significant obstacles, has made the most development in primary school enrollment among all regions.</p>
	<h1 class="cont">Why is it so important?</h1>
	<p class="Why"> Fixing the lack of good education is really important because it helps make things fairer for everyone, especially for
		 people who don’t have many opportunities. Good education helps people get out of poverty and have better lives. 
		 It also helps the economy grow because educated people can come up with new ideas and work better. Education
		  gives people the knowledge and skills to make smart choices about their lives and their communities. It also
		   helps keep peace and understanding between different groups by teaching tolerance and how to work together. 
		   With big problems like climate change and new technology, having educated people is important so we can find solutions
		    and adapt. In the end, helping improve education is the best way to create fairer and better societies.</p>
