	<p class="intro">Since 2000, significant efforts have been made toward achieving universal primary education. The global number of children out of school has been reduced by about half. By 2015, the overall enrollment rate in developing regions has reached 91%. Moreover, literacy rates have soared, and more girls are attending school than ever before, showing remarkable progress.

However, challenges continue to disrupt developing regions due to high poverty rates, armed conflicts, and other crises. Ongoing conflicts in Western Asia and North Africa have led to an increase in the number of children not attending school. Sub-Saharan Africa, despite facing significant obstacles, has made the most development in primary school enrollment among all regions.</p>
