        The struggles that prevent people from receiving a good education are just as 
        serious as its effects. Countries with weak economies and weak education systems often 
        remain stuck in a cycle that is hard to break without any other external support. A strong education system requires a stable economy,
        and a strong economy depends on quality education. This makes ensuring access to education 
        for everyone one of the most important global challenges.  In 2023, adult illiteracy rates remained high, with nearly 32 percent 
        in Sub-Saharan Africa and 25 percent in South Asia who cannot read or write, emphasizing the  need for better educational 
        opportunities to break this cycle and promote development. Below are some common causes of this lack of education: </p>
